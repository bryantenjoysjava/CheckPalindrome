# Thoughts
My first thought was to reverse the string until I remembered seeing a video where the person explained the two-pointer algorithm and how its more efficient. The algorithm involves
instatiating a left and right pointer, where left is the beginning character of the string and right is the end character of the string. For each iteration while the left index is
smaller than the right index, we check if the character at each pointer is the same. The problem was conceptually easy, I struggled the most on taking the original string and trying to
remember the syntax to convert it into an alphanumerical-string only.
